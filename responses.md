The limited multi-notch search has functionality identical to the isotope error option in many current search tools. We made sure that the revised version is clear about this, and we removed any wording that may suggest that this is novel, such as "we propose". Still, the property that it eliminates some wrong matches parallels the discussion in the following multi-notch search section. We feel that it adds to the discussion, and is necessary to make the manuscript complete.
