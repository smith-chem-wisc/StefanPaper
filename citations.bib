We describe here the full workflow of the TPP and the tools therein, along with an example on a sample data set, demonstrating that the setup and use of the tools are straightforward and well supported and do not require specialized informatic resources or knowledge.},

  abstract        = {In shotgun proteomics analysis, user-specified parameters are critical to database search performance and therefore to the yield of confident peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). Two of the most important parameters are related to the accuracy of the mass spectrometer. Precursor mass tolerance defines the peptide candidates considered for each spectrum. Fragment mass tolerance or bin size determines how close observed and theoretical fragments must be to be considered a match. For either of these two parameters, too wide a setting yields randomly high-scoring false PSMs, whereas too narrow a setting erroneously excludes true PSMs, in both cases, lowering the yield of peptides detected at a given false discovery rate. We describe a strategy for inferring optimal search parameters by assembling and analyzing pairs of spectra that are likely to have been generated by the same peptide ion to infer precursor and fragment mass error. This strategy does not rely on a database search, making it usable in a wide variety of settings. In our experiments on data from a variety of instruments including Orbitrap and Q-TOF acquisitions, this strategy yields more high-confidence PSMs than using settings based on instrument defaults or determined by experts. Param-Medic is open-source and cross-platform. It is available as a standalone tool ( http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/param-medic/ ) and has been integrated into the Crux proteomics toolkit ( http://crux.ms ), providing automatic parameter selection for the Comet and Tide search engines.},

  abstract      = {The coupling of electrospray ionization with Fourier-transform mass spectrometry allows the analysis of large biomolecules with mass-measuring errors of less than 1 ppm. The large number of atoms incorporated in these molecules results in a low probability for the all-monoisotopic species. This produces the potential to misassign the number of heavy isotopes in a specific peak and make a mass error of Â±1 Da, although the certainty of the measurement beyond the decimal place is greater than 0.1 Da. Statistical tests are used to compare the measured isotopic distribution with the distribution for a model molecule of the same average molecular mass, which allows the assignment of the monoisotopic mass, even in cases where the monoisotopic peak is absent from the spectrum. The statistical test produces error levels that are inversely proportional to the number of molecules in a distribution, which allows an estimation of the number of ions in the trapped ion cell. It has been determined, via this method that 128 charges are required to produce a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1, which correlates well with previous experimental methods.},
